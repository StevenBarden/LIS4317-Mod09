# LIS4317-Mod09

This script creates a simple multivariate scatterplot using ggplot2 and the mtcars dataset to explore relationships between car weight, fuel efficiency, and cylinder count for a visual analytics assignment.

I created a simple scatterplot for my LIS-4317 Visual Analytics Module 9 assignment using `ggplot2` and the `mtcars` dataset, showing how car weight, fuel efficiency, and cylinder count are related. The plot reveals that heavier cars with more cylinders, like those with 8 (blue dots), usually get lower miles per gallon, while lighter ones with 4 cylinders (red dots) do better. It’s a straightforward way to see these connections, but it might not handle tons of variables as well as fancier methods like Brett Waugh’s PCA. I made sure to keep it clear and minimal, focusing on design principles like clarity and simplicity, and got it all done in under two hours. You can check out the code in `LIS4317Mod09.R` and the plot in `LIS4317Mod09Rplot1.png`—pretty neat for a quick visual!
